Pocket Operators are fantastic *toys* and were mind-blowing the first few times I played with them, but the charm breaks for me as soon as I'm trying to add variation. For example, in order to add a fill at the end of every four bars, you have to copy a pattern to another slot (and there are only 16 slots), make changes there, and chain patterns accordingly. It no longer flows, it's not playful, you have to decide which other patterns to sacrifice, how to rearrange them spatially, etc. I really wish POs had Elektron-style trig conditions: not all of them, but the "A:B" variety, where "1:2" means the first of every two loop repetitions, "4:4" means the last of four, etc. They could even be adjusted using the existing A and B knobs... 🤯
