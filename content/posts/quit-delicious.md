Quit Delicious
==============

I'm not comfortable with [Delicious][] adding quotes to my descriptions.
I don't like [Pinboard][]'s look and URLs.  [Trivium][] is God.

I took these three observations and hacked myself a [link blog][].  It's
generated statically from YAML files and served from [Flask][] for
beautiful URLs, [pjax][] support, and in-memory caching.  The [source][]
is on GitHub.

Live long and self-host.
