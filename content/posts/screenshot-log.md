Screenshot log
==============

Inspired by Pierre Buttin's [Day on a device][], for the last year I was
taking a screenshot every minute in order to visualize my computer use.
I used a Python script and cron, taking screenshots for a user account
that I don't use for client work.

  [Day on a device]: http://www.pierrebuttin.com/work/dayonadevice/

I wanted to create one full size image per day.  I cut a two-pixel-tall
strip from each screenshot and positioned it accordingly to when it was
taken: 00:00 at the top, 12:00 in the middle, 23:59 at the bottom, etc.

I knew in advance these images would be mostly empty and boring. As
I've learned from this experiment, my median weekday computer time is 2
hours 18 minutes. (To be precise, it's how long the screen is on. I'm
not always in front of it.) However, I also knew that on weekends I
sometimes spend significant amount of time behind a keyboard.  That's
when I hoped to get cool-looking glitchy data art.

I'm slightly disappointed that after a year I got only about a dozen of
images that look compelling. Below are my favourite three.
