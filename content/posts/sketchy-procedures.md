Sketchy procedures lead to a beautiful catastrophe
==================================================

Last night I wanted to create a program that could make images that
looked like pencil sketches.  I started with drawing edges of polygons
and it was OK, I quite liked the results.  Then I moved to "coloring" the
polygons, filling them with a zigzag.  I noticed an unexpected behavior
related to rotation of the zigzag.  At first I wanted to find the bug
and solve it, but in the end I decided to embrace it.  With a little bit
of tweaking it produces beautiful forms, some of which look
three-dimensional:

*The results of applying "divide edges" and "zigzag" procedures multiple
times.  Most rows show the same algorithm applied to a triangle, square,
and pentagon, but there are a few images that don't follow this rule.*
