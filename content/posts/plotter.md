Prusa i3 MK2S pen plotter
=========================

Two weekends ago I experimented with changing my [3D printer][] into
a pen plotter. I designed a holder for the pen and attached it to the
extruder motor. As it's often the case with my designs, the third
version worked OK...

I modified two of my generators ([tree][] and [fireball][]) to output
[gcode][] to control the printer. The results are good for a weekend
hack, but they're nowhere near the [AxiDraw][] level.

If I ever return to this project, I'll try to modify the holder to allow
some vertical movement -- the current version often presses the paper
too strongly. I'll also try using a pen a little bit more fancy than an
orange BIC. ðŸ˜‰
