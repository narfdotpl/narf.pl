Procedural photocopier textures
===============================

Yesterday I was taken out by a food poisoning and I couldn't do much.
When I was laying on a couch watching *Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows*, I had an idea.  I thought about creating images that would
look like black printouts from a [photocopier][Kimi].  In the evening I
started feeling better, so I sat down to code.  This is what I have so
far:

And here's a progress video ([YouTube mirror](https://youtu.be/Gf_3na5hBdw)):

Although they don't look as [analog][Belleruche] as I would like, they
make for so-so iPhone ([6][] and [6+][]) wallpapers:
