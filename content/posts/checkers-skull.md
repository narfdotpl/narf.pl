Glitchy Checkers :skull:
========================

I released [Glitchy Checkers 2.0][Press Kit] two weeks ago. I have mixed
feelings. The good thing about shipping is that now I don't think about
this project. It was a recurring obsession and it made me unhappy. I
feel like it was ages ago.

19 people bought the new version. It costs 0.99&nbsp;EUR as a first time
purchase and it's a free update if you bought the iPad version earlier.

It was nice to receive congratulations from friends and colleagues after
the release. I think they're the ones that bought the game. And the ones
reading this. Cześć! :) (I feel like Deadpool now.)

I promoted Checkers on various "social" sites, with limited success.
I also emailed close to two dozens of app sites about three weeks
before the release.  The whole process was disheartening as I was
mostly ignored.  I got responses from two people and a few "buy ads"
auto-replies.  It sucks because without feedback I don't know what
to improve, either about the communication or about the game.  As
far as I know, no one published anything about Glitchy Checkers 2.0.
I'm surprised because 1.0 was covered by a couple of blogs and it
was iPad-only, had no single player mode, no press kit, worse touch
handling, etc.  Maybe updates are less interesting than launches.

I didn't have high hopes but I'm slightly disappointed.  I guess I feel
this way because I thought I was making something between a [hobby
game][Extra Credits] and an "indie" game.  In hindsight it's clear I was
far on the left side of this spectrum.

I enjoy not thinking about Checkers, so I'll leave it to collect dust
in some data center on a tropical planet. I won't do more marketing or
any other activities that feel like work.  Regarding future endeavours,
I plan to not confuse things one does for pleasure with things one does
for money.
