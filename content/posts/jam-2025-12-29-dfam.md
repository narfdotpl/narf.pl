Jam: Drummer From Another Manufacturer
======================================

Under the Christmas tree, I found a Drummer From Another Manufacturer (Behringer EDGE, the Moog DFAM clone). It's gnarly.

I was fascinated by the DFAM for a long time. I tried it out in person, but I never got it because of the price, lack of MIDI connectivity, not convincing build quality, tiny knobs, and questionable ergonomics of using it on a couch.

When I learned that Behringer cloned it, I was at first put off by the fact that they copied a new product, then shocked by the price, and finally I was astonished that they improved it in all the ways that I care about (see the list above). In my opinion it's a better product and it makes a great gift for anyone interested in synthesis.
