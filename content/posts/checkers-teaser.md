Checkers: Teaser
================

I'm working on a futuristic checkers game for the iPad.  Things glitch,
shatter, and explode.  This is much of a lab project: the current
version is the fifth implementation in the fourth language (Swift +
SpriteKit).  Having said that, the plan is to ship it.

As an experiment, I've set up a [newsletter][] you can sign up for to
get updates about the project.  If you'd like to have early access to
the game, email me at <checkers@narf.pl>.

Meanwhile, here's a glimpse of the current aesthetic:
