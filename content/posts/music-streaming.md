description: It has changed the way I listen to music.

Impact of music streaming on my listening habits
================================================

I have switched from "regular MP3s" to music streaming in early 2013,
when [Spotify][] became available in Poland.

It has changed the way I listen to music.

Some changes were qualitative -- for example, I started listening to
[playlists][], instead of being a full album purist.  Other changes,
like the number of artists I listen to, were quantitative.  In this post
I focus on the latter and use graphs of [my Last.fm data][Last.fm] to
[visually verify][disinformation] some hypotheses.

Context
-------

Before I tell you about Spotify, let me describe my music situation.

I listen to music a lot and I am very picky about what I listen to.  I
have "always" been like this.  I don't think there have been many days
since I was 12, during which I was not listening to the music of my
liking for at least three hours.

I listen to music when I work, commute, relax, read, run, cook (I only
make breakfasts, but still...), do chores, etc.  In a first-order
approximation: if I'm not listening to music or [podcasts][], I'm either
a) in a social situation in which it's not appropriate, or b) on a
motorcycle.

For the last twelve years or more, I've been listening almost
exclusively to MP3s, almost always to full albums.  Notably, I
don't listen to the radio -- I discover new music through friends'
recommendations and various internet things related to the artists I
already like.

This is how the landscape looks like, when music streaming enters the
scene.

Spotify
-------

During the first day of using Spotify I was confused.  Then I realized
it's not [some magical service][Pandora] my friends have been talking
about, which uses artificial intelligence to know what I want to listen
to better than myself.  No, Spotify is much simpler at its core -- it
almost feels like iTunes with a dark UI.  There's just one tiny little
detail, though: Spotify has access not only to my local MP3 library, but
also to godzillabytes of music on their servers.

> This changes everything.

There are many ways to play music in this app.  You can start with your
own or someone else's playlist, you can use search, you can start a
"radio" based on a particular song, album, artist, or playlist, you
can see what your Facebook friends are listening to right now, and so
on.  The way I discover new music is using the "Related Artists" section
on artists' pages and through the "Browse > Discover" tab, which has
impressively good suggestions.  This is the way I found two bands from
my [Top 5 Metal Albums of 2014][top5] list:  Monuments and Abolish The
Echelon.

  [top5]: /posts/my-top-5-metal-albums-of-2014

After I stumble upon a new artist that I want to listen to, I usually
enqueue three of their most popular songs or three first tracks of their
most popular album.  If I like them, I add a full album to the queue.

The queue works in such a way that it overrules the order of tracks that
are going to be played.  Regardless of what album, playlist, etc. you
are listening to, if you have something in the queue, the next track
played will be from the top of the queue.  You can think of it as of an
improvised playlist.  I love this feature and use it heavily.

When I hear a song that I would like to listen to again in the future,
I add it to my "Starred" playlist.  After two years I have about 2000
songs in there.  I mainly use it to find "that great song from a week
ago".  Sporadically I play all my stars on shuffle (I almost never
shuffle anything) to get an endless stream of great music.  The only
problem with this approach is that the genre changes can be quite
abrupt: from progressive rock slash alternative pop to grindcore to
piano ambient to gypsy punk to industrial glitch to brit rock to...

Anyway, back to the story.

For the first few weeks of using the service, I felt like I was
listening to *way* more music.  More importantly, almost every song felt
new to me -- both "I don't have this MP3" new and "I haven't heard this
before" new.


Play count
----------

This "I listen more" feeling was the first thing I wanted to verify
against data.  To do so, I created a play count graph and colored
old and new tracks differently.  Let's take a look:

![](play-count.png)

As you can see, I was wrong about the first part -- total play count
(dark bars + light bars) didn't change when I started using music
streaming.  I mean, yeah, bars on the right are generally higher than on
the left, but take a look at the period around the switch, even the whole
year from August 2012 to August 2013 (vacation months).  If old and new
tracks had the same color and there was no green bar at the bottom, you
wouldn't be able to tell when the Spotify period began.

On the other hand, the second part of the hypothesis (that I listen to
new music) was spot on!  The first month of using Spotify was the first
month where the majority of music I played was new (excluding the first
three months near the left edge of the graph, where there was so little
data in the library that almost every song was new).  Months following
the Spotify switch also have high percentages of new tracks.

Encouraged by the initial results and curious if the strong "Spotify
effect" I felt could be more visible (or rather: puzzled that it's
not as visible), I decided to look at the data from different angles
and investigate the number of unique tracks and the number of artists
I listened to.


Tracks
------

Looking at the tracks graph, the pre-streaming/streaming divide is
much clearer:

![](tracks.png)

Not only the average number of tracks is higher in the Spotify section,
but the number of new tracks is just impressive.  This is that "OMG
everything is new!" feeling right there in the picture.

To not get completely carried away, I have to share an observation about
the nature of the data visible above.

Despite the fact that I find *a lot* of genuinely good songs now, I
think that the shape of the graph is amplified by the fact that in the
MP3 days I had to put more effort into getting music into my library.
Therefore, I filtered it more, e.g. I checked it out on YouTube first,
which isn't connected to my Last.fm library.  Once something got in, I
would listen to it at least a couple of times.

Today, when I stumble upon a song I don't like too much, I listen to
it once (or just skip it) and move along.  But once I do this, these
one-time-songs are remembered in my Last.fm library and visible on the
graph.

Either way, Spotify scores a lot of points here, because it combines
"regular listening" and music discovery in one app and makes the latter
effortless.


Artists
-------

Finally, let's take a look at the artists graph.  Intuitively I was
expecting its shape to be similar to the tracks figure above.  Turns
out, Spotify's just *crushing* regular MP3s:

![](artists.png)

The lowest bar (new + old) from the music streaming period is higher
than any bar from the iTunes era.  Compared to the right side, the "new
artists" bars on the left are so low they seem non-existent.

These results look dramatic and fit nicely with my "more diverse music"
theory.

Also, they suggest that the perceived diversity is correlated more with
the number of artists than with the number of tracks.  Which makes
sense, because in general there's more diversity between artists than
between songs of a given artist.

I posted an [imgur mirror][] of this graph (with a slightly longer
title) to the [Data Is Beautiful subreddit][].  Feel free to join the
discussion there.  Also, if you'd like to share an image from this post
on social media, this is the one. :)

Update â€¢ 2015-04-26
-------------------

Wow, I didn't expect this article to do *this* well!  The reception was
really good, with many comments, a couple of tweets, and even a few
emails from people at Spotify.  Thanks to everyone for the kind words,
it was a very nice feeling! :)

[The Reddit post][Reddit] hit [the front page][front page] (*sic!*) and
ended up with a score of 3400 and a mind-boggling number of 850,000
imgur image views that used 49 GB of transfer.  Google Analytics numbers
are more modest (link to the article was in the image and in my
top-level comment) but still the best for any of my posts: 2200
pageviews.

I followed [Tips for making a successful Original Content [OC]
post][tips], paying special attention to [the submission graph][].
I posted at 14 UTC on Tuesday.

There were 345 comments under the post.  Redditors mostly agreed
that Spotify is a good service for the listeners but expressed concerns
about the amount of money that goes to the artists.

I especially liked one [comment][] made by /u/Jahkral, who suggested
adding a third color for tracks/artists discovered in the last few
months.  This is a very good idea, a one that would help to show if I
keep listening to the music I find.  I'll use this approach if I revisit
the subject in the future.

A few people thanked for the "Technical outline" section.  I think
it's good to share information about the process, as well as code and
raw data, even if it's not perfect or well-documented.  Some pointed
out that I left an API key in my script, which I am thankful for (I
revoked the key, there's no need to message me about removing it from
the repo history).  There was even one [pull request][], created by
Elliot Bentley, adding documentation for my scripts.  Thanks!

Conclusion
----------

Thanks to the switch to music streaming and Spotify features like
"Related Artists" and "Discover", I listen to more artists than ever
before and find hundreds of new tracks every month.

My music life is more diverse and I feel that my overall quality of life
is higher because of that.

Thumbs up for Spotify.


Technical outline
-----------------

I used [Last.fm API][] to retrieve data that I've been [scrobbling][]
for years via iTunes and Spotify.  With a Python script, I downloaded
weekly track charts and saved them in JSON files.  With another (quite
ugly) Python script, I grouped, analyzed, and saved this data in CSV
files.  (I started writing this post over a year before publishing it.
Today, I would have used Swift to process data -- the same language I'm
writing [a game](/checkers) in *#shamelessplug*.)

I visualized CSV data with [D3.js][] and CoffeeScript.  It was the first
time I used D3 and I am very happy with the results.  I based my work on
[Mike Bostock's tutorial][tutorial].  The tutorial is not perfect for
complete beginners, but is sufficient for people with web
programming<wbr/>experience.

The most important thing I learned about D3 is the fact that it's
not a library for creating charts, but rather a framework for writing
visualisation programs.

As always, [data and code][] are on GitHub.
