A few months ago I started [dabbling][GarageBand] in procedural
music. Recently I gave it another shot and created the first
piece/sketch that I'm happy to share here. I called it
"Random&nbsp;encounters" because of euclidean rhythm [polymeters][]
that form its foundation. These rhythms are loops of different lengths,
therefore when any one of them repeats, it meets the others at different
points.

I made this track in [Orca][], an esoteric programming language
and live-coding environment. I connected it to Ableton Live where
it controls a few copies of the [Lekko][] piano and one virtual
bass guitar.

I like the layers of contrast that are at play here:

- On one hand, it's hard to imagine a more digital way of making
  music â€” everything is done on a computer and represented as code in
  a programming language that looks like it's taken from _The Matrix_.
  On the other hand, this piece is played on a piano, an instrument
  with a classic, warm, analog sound.

- Even though I'm writing and executing code, this is not the traditional
  slow and disconnected process that culminates in the press of a button,
  which runs the full program, generates the entire audio file and saves
  it to disk. To the contrary. The video above is actually a recording of
  a live performance with no post-processing: I'm changing the code as I'm
  hearing the music it makes, in sync with the beat. I'm also tweaking the
  volume of different tracks using knobs on a MIDI controller. Doing all of
  this in the moment, with immediate feedback, and having the tactile
  sensation of adjusting knobs... All of this creates an experience that
  sits somewhere between playing an instrument and playing a video game
  of one's own design.
