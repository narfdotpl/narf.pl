*"All those moments will be lost in time..."*

<br/>On the last day of 2020, it felt right to publish this animation,
comprised of 2020 frames. Itâ€™s a compute shader that I created in Unity,
using 40,000 "[birds][boids]". After I was done with visuals, I made the
music using the [Lekko][] piano and Ableton Live.
