65daysofstatic's soundtrack to No Man's Sky
===========================================

[65daysofstatic][], a math-/post-rock instrumental band that I
sometimes listen to, recorded a soundtrack to [No Man's Sky][], a
recently released PS4 and PC space game most known for its heavy use of
procedural generation: in the game there are billions and billions of
unique *planets* that you can explore, complete with terrain, plants,
and animals.

I haven't played the game because I don't have the hardware, but
I like the soundtrack, especially the second album.  I've listened
to the whole thing a couple of times.  With its sci-fi aesthetic it
makes a good background for programming (or taking a long journey by
train).  You can listen to it on [Spotify][] and [YouTube][] (where it
was uploaded illegally?).

When I first read that 65 made the soundtrack I was filled with optimism
and happy for Hello Games — that they started as a small studio and
managed to work with such a good and, for me, famous band.  The more
I read about their collaboration the more it sounded like a perfect
story.  Sadly, it turns bittersweet at the end.

I encourage you to read the whole interviews with 65 on [The Verge][],
and [WIRED][] yourself, but the gist is that they had great autonomy and
the whole story started like a fairytale:

Just like other elements of No Man's Sky, its sound also has procedural
aspects.  It reacts to what the player is doing, which in such an open
game can't be known in advance.  The soundtrack is "remixed" on the fly
by the game:

> We’re actually working on that now with Paul. We’re taking the
> sessions from the record, which were mixed and mastered some time
> ago, and we’re diving back into those and pulling elements out, and
> then re-recording more variation, more complimentary sounds.

This introduces interesting challenges to the creative process:

> You know that you have to make a record and that the record has to
> make sense and be accessible, and at the same time you know that all
> of that music is totally destroyable and it’s going to be atomized
> and rendered in a great number of variations.

To me, all of this sounds just so great and so uplifting.  It reignites
the desire to create things independently.  Alas, the final words of the
WIRED interview remind me what the financial situation of many artists is
like:

> The games world seems like something worth paying attention to and if
> I can ever afford a PS4 then that's for me.

It made me sad and reminded me of [Monuments][], one of my favourite
bands.  A few weeks ago I was to another show of theirs.  I had a great
time and it was clearly visible that the band was having a blast too:
the singer was walking on the ceiling while crowd surfing (singing the
whole time), etc.

In my head what they have is the definition of success: they make the
music they want, have hundreds of thousands of views/plays on the
internet, they travel the world to play concerts, and people come
specifically to see them and to do wild things in front of the stage.

It'd be hard to do better.

But after they come off the stage and go to the merchandise table, you
realise that it's a small club, that the ticket was super cheap, and
that all band members look tired because they play 3–5 shows a week for
half a year.  The best you can do is invite friends to such concerts and
after the show go the merch table and buy some generic/stock t-shirt
with the band's name on it, that the singer sells from a suitcase.

Turns out, it doesn't matter if some programmer thinks you're famous.
Having a million hits doesn't mean you'll make the ends meet:

To end in this sad tone, I'll just mention that No Man's Sky reception
is not great.  A lot of 6/10 reviews.  It's terrifying to commit a
substantial part your life to doing a thing that undoubtedly will be
judged by others.

If you'd like to read or watch more about No Man's Sky, I gather
interesting materials about it on my [link blog][].
