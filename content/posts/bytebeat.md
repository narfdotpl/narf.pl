Bytebeat: live-coding sound waves
=================================

This weekend I [stumbled upon](https://martyn.me/projects/bytebeats/)
bytebeat, a mind-blowing way of creating music, where you don't use
instruments or notes.  Instead, you create mathematical formulas for
the amplitude of the sound wave *(sic!)*.  It's an amazing, exciting
idea: you do away with musical abstractions and directly describe *the
movement of air*.

What makes it even more captivating is the fact that those formulas can
be very short.  They can be one-line programs.

You can find a thorough introduction to bytebeat in an article by
NaiveSound titled ["Glitch: a noisy fusion of math and music"][article].
After going through basics, the author presents more advanced concepts
and provides links to other articles and presentations.  Crucially,
NaiveSound also gives an easy-to-use synthesizer that runs in a web
browser.  The editor supports live coding: the sound changes as you type,
provided there are no syntax errors in your formula.  If there are
errors, the last valid version is used.  It's great fun and it feels a
little bit like playing an instrument -- you have to make changes at the
right time if you want them to sound good.

Here are two tracks I composed (discovered?).  I recorded them live
using QuickTime and [Soundflower][]:

I had a great time playing those but I have to admit that after a few
hours of experimentation with bytebeat the initial excitement started
to fade a little bit.  Maybe this won't be the tool that will allow me
to add reactive sound to [Glitchy Checkers][].
Maybe.  Maybe the fact that I enjoy making noise with code is an
indication that I should refresh my Ruby and give [Sonic Pi][] a
try? (Thanks to Maciej Gajewski for the recommendation.)

Time will tell.  Meanwhile, I encourage you to give bytebeat
[a try][synthesizer].  It's a rewording intellectual and creative experience.

Glitch got [updated][] and gained a lot of functionality.  It
is now easier to make complex noises that don't sound like NES
games.  Here's me pretending to be Nine Inch Nails' [Alessandro
