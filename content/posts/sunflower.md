Sunflower
=========

![](sunflower.mp4)

This is the conclusion to the thought I had about a golden
sunflower/turbine/radiator. I made it in Python and Blender, after
adding support for surfaces to my [metal spaghetti tree][spaghetti]
generator.

Projects like this are my favourite: ones where I can go from idea to
completion in one sitting.  (With small [adventures][bug] along the way.)

The video above is an infinite loop of a sunflower blowing in the
wind. I find it especially mesmerizing and calming on full screen.
Unfortunately, the quality of the video is a little bit too low for my
liking -- 1080p60 instead of 4k and too noisy, even though rendering
took ~15h.  Making the video at my desired quality would take almost
a week on my hardware, so I accepted that the 1080 version is Good
Enoughâ„¢.  Here's a 5k by 5k frame to give you a taste of what it
might've been, though:
