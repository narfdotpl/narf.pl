Menu bar

Encouraged by the above quote from a coworker, I decided to write about
the top right corner of my screen.

This is my desktop.

The wallpaper is ["M3 Duality"][wallpaper].  Apps in the dock
are [Finder][], [iTerm][], [Spotify][], [Chrome][], [Clear][],
and [MacVim][] with an [alternate icon][].

The menu bar is simple.  Most icons are hidden[1] by [Bartender][].
The only items visible all the time are network[2] and CPU[3] graphs from
[MenuMeters][].  I find them very useful when writing my own, and using
other people's, programs.

I use Bartender with a custom, [transparent icon][].  When I need to
access a hidden item, I click to the left of the network graph.

[Slate][][4].  Other items are system icons.
