Housekeeping
============

In the first half of the year I did some housekeeping around my websites, servers, and computers:

- I added an [/about](/about) page with a photo that my wife took of me. I also updated my avatar in a bunch of places. The plan is to eventually create a reel highlighting my favourite projects, but it would take a few evenings and is not a priority now.
- I moved both this site and my [link blog](https://links.narf.pl/) from Dokku on Digital Ocean to [Render](https://render.com), which made them run and deploy faster, problem-free, and added https. I might convert my link blog to a static site, if I find an evening to do that. Update 2024-10-31: it took me [one hour](https://github.com/narfdotpl/links/commit/cfa6f2b7155f63f28c684c3047acfcc5eb8e62cf).
- I updated the [macOS setup post](/posts/mac-software-2022) after yet another work MacBook died on me.
- Speaking of faulty electronics, one of the microcontrollers in my [Corne](https://github.com/narfdotpl/zmk-config) died when I was about to fly out to New York, so I ordered a new one with an over-night shipping from Amsterdam (so cosmopolitan...), soldered it, and resurrected the keyboard just in time for the trip. That keyb deserves a post of its own, but I am yet to find the right way to approach writing it.
- Also related to hardware, in a surprising turn of events, I started using a 2018 Intel MacBook in the living room. It's the first time in... 15 years...? that I'm using a laptop as a laptop (without an external display). I got a high [stand](https://allegro.pl/oferta/15535943830) for it, and I have my keyboard and mouse, which all make it comfortable-enough, even though the screen is small (15 inches). I actually like the fact that it's a more ad hoc setup that I can use in a shared room.
