Genuary 22: gradients
=====================

![](photo.jpg)

[Genuary][] 22: gradients based on the "gradients only" prompt. I'm quite happy with the hand-drawn effect that I implemented (used on the left and right image). Other than that, my Genuary process solidifies to be:

- rush to implement the tech
- run out of time, cut scope
- spend 15 minutes traversing n-dimensional space to find something that looks ok
- plot it
- immediately notice a few things to improve
- too late, move on
- look at the image a week later
- like it more than in the beginning (hopefully)
