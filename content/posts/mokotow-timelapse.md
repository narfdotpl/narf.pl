Mokot√≥w timelapse
=================

I've hacked together an app for taking high resolution multi-hour
timelapses using a 16 GB iPhone.  The phone takes a full-resolution
photo every five seconds and immediately uploads it over wifi to a
computer that has more storage.  I then crop, resize, and combine images
into a movie.

For the first long test (over 20 hours) I left the phone on a windowsill
and pointed it roughly in the direction of the sky (I couldn't frame the
shot well during the night).  I was lucky enough to capture a moonrise,
direct sunlight, neighbours on the roof, a few planes, various types of
clouds...  I'm amazed how well it came out.

All camera settings are automatic and apart from cropping and resizing
I didn't do any post-processing.
