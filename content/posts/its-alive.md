It's alive
==========

A little over a week ago I've finished making the first complete
prototype of my robot.  Many issues, a lot of room for improvement, some
trivia to tell over a meal, etc., etc.  Currently I don't feel like
working on it, but I'll probably return to the project in a few weeks or
months.  Regardless of what I do with it in the future, in my mind I can
already put a check mark in the "build a robot" field and be happy with
how it "runs":
