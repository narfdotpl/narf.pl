Instapaper &lt; Readability
===========================

I've been using [Readability][] since it was a bookmarklet developed
by [Arc90][].  Today I use three of their products: a Chrome Extension,
an iPad app, and an iPhone app.

[A few weeks ago][homescreen] I decided to give [Instapaper][] a try.
I really wanted to like it -- it'd be heartwarming if a sole developer
could create a polished product and make a sustainable business out of
it.  Although I'm convinced that [Marco][] is doing well financially, his
product is far from being polished.  In my three weeks with Instapaper
I was mostly annoyed and often forced to switch back to Readability due
to Instapaper's parsing problems.

I gathered here a list of pros and cons of each service.

Instapaper
----------

Pros:

- payed app
- pagination
- optional "oldest first" ordering
- grid view on iPad


Cons:

- frequent crashes (initially on an iPad I was experiencing one crash every
  two/three articles)
- confusing UI that requires too many taps
- too many settings
- crappy parser (missing paragraphs, images, etc.)
- broken links in Wikipedia articles
- bugs (sometimes I can't archive an article in the grid view, but I can in
  the article view)
- no support for "browse the web and quickly make a page readable" workflow
  (try to read [Programming in Lua][PIL]...)
- support for only one device orientation (especially annoying when you're
  using an iPad upside down because it's charging)

Readability
-----------

Pros:

- good parser
- aesthetic design
- intuitive gestures
- simplicity
- official Chrome Extension


Cons:

- free app (you are the product)
- occasional sync problems (that can be fixed by re-downloading articles)

Update • 2015-06-26
-------------------

About two weeks ago I switched from Readability to Instapaper because of
the following reasons:

1. Readability's sync is slow and unreliable.
1. There's an annoying visual bug after switching between portrait and
   landscape orientations on an iPad.
1. It looks like an abandonware: the last minor app update was on
   2014-10-24 and the last post on [their blog](http://blog.readability.com/)
   is from 2014-01-23.
1. Marco [sold Instapaper][] a month after my post.  It's become a better
   product in the last two years.  I like it.
