Plain Text
==========

I've won an inner battle.  A major one.  In fact, I wouldn't believe
something like this could be called a "victory", until now.  I've
chosen the technology for my blag.  I won't use [Jekyll][], I won't use
[Hyde][], I won't spend any more time writing my own engine.  I'll use
plain text files.
