Leaving Spotify, Gmail, Instagram, Slack, etc.
=======

It feels good to reduce unnecessary weight.
I was stuck with many digital "defaults", but this summer I have left:

- Gmail -- replaced with Hey
- Instagram
- Spotify -- replaced with Apple Music and Bandcamp
- DistroKid
- Slack -- replaced with Ableton Live
- RP Hypertrophy
- ...

It's so trivial that I don't really want to write about it, but at the same time it had an impact on my daily life. Plus I have to address the Ek in the room.

For each thing that I've left or replaced there are trade-offs, nuances, alternatives to consider, etc. I don't want to get into any of that here.

North star
----------

Reduce weight.
Reduce input.
Reduce performative parasocial "relationships".
Get bored.
Don't support companies that you don't want to support.
Don't use things that you hate.
Like reels/shorts/tiktoks are a fucking poison.
And then there's Spotify...

Spotify and DistroKid
-------

When I started making music, my thinking was:

1. Make something and see if I like it.
2. Make more and release it as an album on Spotify.

Releasing an album on Spotify was validation. And it offered a sliver of a shadow of a chance that maybe enough people will like what I do that I will earn some money. Not a lot, but maybe enough in a year to pay for a plugin or two. Spotify wants you to think that musicians earn money. Meanwhile, they're trying hard to pay artists as little as possible, preferably nothing.

Spotify is co-founded and ran by Daniel Ek. Ek has invested hundreds of millions of euros in weapons.

One can't upload music to Spotify directly. I paid for a DistroKid subscription to do it. Ek/Spotify are investors in DistroKid.

There's more and I had background awareness of some of it, but seeing it all at once in a [Red Means Recording video][], was the drop that overflowed the goblet of bitterness.

I have removed my music from Spotify, stopped using them as a listener, and stopped paying for DistroKid. Leaving DistroKid had a side effect of removing my music from Apple Music. Get it on {{ profiles.bandcamp.tag }}.

*PS If you are a Spotify subscriber, you've read this far, and you still feel an urge to give money for music software to a Swede with an intriguingly short name starting with the letter E, consider choosing [Ess][] instead.*
