Papier
======

Here are a few snapshots from my recent explorations centered around the
theme of paper.

My goal was to "make something white" and play with gravitational
fields, flow fields, spirals, depth of field, subsurface scattering,
etc.  As usual, most of the things didn't work out (for example I ended
up using a very simple diffuse material with no SSS).

As with previous projects, I wrote Python programs that created the
geometry which I later rendered in Blender.

When working on new ideas or trying to fix bugs, I was using a simpler
rendering technique. I like a couple of those images too.
