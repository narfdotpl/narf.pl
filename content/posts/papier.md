Papier
======

Here are a few snapshots from my recent explorations around the theme
of paper.  My goal was to to "make something white" and play with
gravitational fields, flow fields, spirals, depth of field, subsurface
scattering, etc.  As usual, most of the things didn't work out (for
example I ended up using a very simple diffuse material with no SSS) but
overall this was a productive exercise.

(Refresh the page if images are not full-width. I'll track this bug
later.)

    <img data='{"max_width": 5120, "max_height": 2880}' src="triptych1.jpg"/>
</figure>

As with previous projects, I wrote Python programs that created the
geometry which I later rendered in Blender.

When working on new ideas or trying to fix bugs, I was using a simpler
rendering technique. I like a couple of those images as well.
