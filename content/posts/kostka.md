Kostka

*Kostka* is one of the failed projects.

Usually I show these only in Instagram Stories, if at all, but this one
looks good enough that I decided to publish it.

It was supposed to be a looping animation of a glass cube/transformer
based on a random doodle I drew when thinking about something else.
The image above is what I managed to salvage from this idea.

I love the way the light and the glass look in this shot.

Before I decided to abandon it, this is was a long and painful project
full of unforeseen difficulties.  I can't find the energy to describe
all of the problems but they revolved mostly around glitches in lighting
and bevelling (finely rounded edges are crucial to the whole aesthetic,
trust me).  To achieve the realistic glass I've finally upgraded to
Blender 2.8 and used the LuxCore rendering engine, known for its
impressive caustics.  Unfortunately, I encountered issues that I
haven't been able to understand or work around. The renderer seems
hypersensitive to changes in geometry. Even the smallest change in the
model can result in a big change in lighting, which makes the video
[flicker][] unbearably.  Of course this might be a consequence of the
way I'm using this engine, but as I've said, I don't know what the cause
is and I wasn't able to get help.

At this point in my 3D adventures I should probably "just learn
Houdini" instead of coding these things from scratch and relying on
non-commercial tools, but I keep saying to myself that I indulge in
this hobby too infrequently to justify the time commitment involved in
learning a new piece of software...

Anyway, the glass looks good. Some of the "happy little accidents" along
the way were cool too. We'll see what the future brings.
