JSON feed
=========

Today I [learned][Trivium] about [JSON feed][], an alternative to RSS
and Atom formats.  I've almost always chosen JSON over XML.  It's easier
to read and write, both by hand and in a programming environment.  I
would like to live in a world where JSON feeds are popular enough that
it is expected that readers support them -- so that writers won't have
to deal with legacy XML formats.  Because of this I [added][commit] my
own [`/feed.json`](/feed.json).  It took one hour, including writing
this post.
