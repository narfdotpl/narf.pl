Genuary 2: flower meadow
========================

[Genuary][] 2: flower meadow for my three-year-old based on the "layers upon layers upon layers" prompt.

Pen plotter trivia: it took the NextDraw plugin (within Inkscape) about 15 minutes to figure out which paths should not be drawn because they are occluded by layers above (each flower petal is a separate layer). Maybe I should use lower resolution polygons for the "white fill" elements to speed the process up...
